# Yubnub
An iOS application that displays the information for people in the Star Wars universe provided by the SWAPI (https://swapi.dev)

## Features
Yubnub is a simple List/Detail view application that shows a list of the characters in the Star Wars movies and displays them. Tapping on a Person's row navigate to the Detail View of that Person which contains more information.

## Future Features
- Additional data types for planets, ships, etc. And the ability to chose these on the main screen
- Ability to recursively fetch these other types to make cross-linking in details screen possible
- Ability to drill down navigation-wise through multiple details screens
- The SWAPI does not contain images, it would be great to cross-reference with another location to get a basica image for the entry being viewed.

## Usage
- The SWAPI does not require an API key. You should be able to clone this repo and run without having to make any changes beside licensing/provisioning if needed.
